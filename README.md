Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline

Overview
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to enable users to interact with structured and unstructured data extracted from websites. The system allows users to query website data and receive accurate, context-rich responses generated by a selected Large Language Model (LLM).

Functional Requirements

1. Data Ingestion
*Input*: URLs or a list of websites to crawl/scrape.

*Process*:
- Crawl and scrape content from the target websites.
- Extract key data fields, metadata, and textual content.
- Segment the content into logical chunks for better granularity.
- Convert the chunks into vector embeddings using a pre-trained embedding model.
- Store the embeddings in a vector database with associated metadata for efficient retrieval.

2. Query Handling
*Input*: User's natural language question.

*Process*:
- Convert the user's query into vector embeddings using the same embedding model.
- Perform a similarity search in the vector database to retrieve the most relevant chunks.
- Pass the retrieved chunks to the LLM with a prompt or agentic context to generate a detailed response.

3. Response Generation
*Input*: Relevant information retrieved from the vector database and the user query.

*Process*:
- Use the LLM with retrieval-augmented prompts to produce responses with exact values and context.
- Ensure factuality by directly incorporating retrieved data into the response.

Example Websites
The pipeline will crawl and extract data from the following websites:
- [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/)
- [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/)
- [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/)
- [University of North Dakota](https://und.edu/)

Installation

Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

Required Libraries
Install the necessary libraries using pip:
bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4


Usage

Step 1: Data Ingestion
Use the provided script to scrape data from the example websites. This script uses requests and BeautifulSoup to extract textual content from websites.

python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def scrape_website(session, url):
    try:
        response = session.get(url, timeout=10)
        response.raise_for_status()
        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
        text_content = soup.get_text(separator=' ', strip=True)
        return text_content
    except requests.exceptions.SSLError as ssl_err:
        print(f"SSL error occurred: {ssl_err}")
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as req_err:
        print(f"Request error occurred: {req_err}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        return None

urls = [
    "https://www.uchicago.edu/",
    "https://www.washington.edu/",
    "https://www.stanford.edu/",
    "https://und.edu/",
]

with requests.Session() as session:
    scraped_data = {}
    for url in urls:
        content = scrape_website(session, url)
        if content:
            print(f"Successfully scraped content from {url}")
            scraped_data[url] = content


Step 2: Query Handling
Run the query handler to search through the scraped content:

python
def answer_query(query, scraped_data):
    results = []
    query = query.lower()
    for url, content in scraped_data.items():
        if query in content.lower():
            results.append((url, content))
    return results

user_query = input("Enter your query: ")
results = answer_query(user_query, scraped_data)

if results:
    print("Search results:")
    for url, content in results:
        print(f"\nFrom: {url}\nContent: {content[:200]}...")
else:
    print("No matching results found.")


Step 3: Response Generation
This script provides the raw matching content. You can integrate it with an LLM like OpenAI's GPT for advanced response generation.



## Future Enhancements
- Add vector database support for efficient retrieval.
- Integrate with LLMs for advanced response generation.
- Enhance crawling to handle dynamic website content.
